Beat around the bush 
Get your act together 
Hit the sack 
Your guess is as good as mine 
Good things come to those who wait 
Back against the wall 
Up in arms 
Scrape the barrel 
Burn your boats/bridges 
Break fresh 
New ground 
Sell like hot cakes 
Run around in circles 
On cloud nine 
Left out in the cold 
Blow hot and cold 
Cut corner 
Boil the ocean 
Keep an ear to the ground 
Eat like a horse 
A snowball effect 
Two birds with one stone 
Chip off the old block 
Don't cry over spilt milk 
Every cloud has a silver lining 
Beside yourself with joy
Fair and square
Having an Ace up the sleeve
A black sheep
Hook, line and sinker
Looking to your laurels
Bear a grudge
By the skin of your teeth
Down for the count
Draw the line
Easier said than done
Break a leg
Up a creek without a paddle
Give it a whirl
Fish out of water
In the fast lane
Go the extra mile
Snug as a bug in a rug
Step up your game
To not see the wood for the trees
Lose your marbles
Straight from the Horse’s mouth
Crying Wolf
Palm off
Has bigger fish to fry
Look before you leap
On thin ice
Play devil’s advocate
Rain on someone’s parade
Take a rain check
Take it with a grain of salt
Like a cakewalk
Throw caution to the wind
Penny wise and Pound foolish
The whole nine yards
The best thing since sliced bread
Bite off more than you can chew
Play by the ear
Ignorance is bliss
Put something on ice
You can say that again
Bite the bullet
Go back to the drawing board
Call it a day
Beating Around the Bush
Be in a Tight Corner
At the Eleventh Hour
Swan Song
Wild Goose Chase
Bury the Hatchet
To Bell the Cat
Turn a deaf ear
At Sea
To be in the doldrums
Hit the books
Twist someone’s arm
Stab someone in the back
Go cold turkey
Ring a bell
Cut to the chase
Blow off steam
Break the bank
Face the music
It is always darkest before the dawn
Jump the gun
Wear your heart on your sleeve
Cut no ice
Light at the end of tunnel
Cry for the moon
Read between the lines
Pour out one’s heart
A left-handed compliment
Once in a blue moon
A slap on the wrist
Once bitten, twice shy
